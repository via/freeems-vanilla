		 * - offset for each output event TDC
		 * - desired timing value in degrees BTDC
		 * - a minimum post tooth delay
		 * - angle to ticks conversion number
		 *
		 * we want:
		 *
		 * - which event to fire from
		 * - how much to wait after that event before firing
		 *
		 * we need to:
		 *
		 * - to find the code angle that the spark must jump at
		 * - find nearest event
		 * - find time after nearest event to spark needing to jump
		 * - check that dwell + min delay < time after nearest
		 * - if so, set event number in output as nearest
		 * - and, set after delay to (distance between - dwell)
		 * - if not, set event number in output to one before nearest
		 * - and, set after delay to same + expected delay between nearest and next
		 *
		 * repeat per pin (this is in a loop)
		 *
		 * NOTE this is sub-optimal, the spark firing should be scheduled close to the closest tooth
		 *      and dwell start should be = or greater than requested dwell and equal or less than max dwell
		 *      ie, dwell can be MUCH more than requested in order to get the closest to event spark possible
		 *      the output code was designed for fuel use, hence this current behaviour. It will be adjusted
