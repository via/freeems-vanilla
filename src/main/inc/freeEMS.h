/** @page bankedRunningVariables Banked Running Variables
 *
 * This page is to document and explain the operation of the banked running variable system and structure.
 *
 * The program running variables are divided into three broad groups: inputs, working
 * and outputs. For both the input and output groups there are two copies of each set
 * of variables, whereas there is only one copy of each set in the working group. This
 * is required to allow both the inputs and outputs to be safely written and read at
 * the same time. To facilitate this all sets of variables within the input and output
 * groups are referenced with two pointers each. For the input group, the copy pointed
 * to is swapped when fresh data is both available to and required by the mathematics
 * function. For the output group the copy pointed to is swapped when the mathematics
 * function has produced new output data. The input data is supplied by the engine
 * position interrupt service routines as ADC readings and RPM values. The output data
 * consists of pulse widths, timing angles, dwell periods and scheduling information.
 *
 * Accessory functions (Idle, Boost, etc)
 *
 * In order to achieve minimal latency and maximum frequency of execution of the
 * main mathematics code the accessory functions must run asynchronously. Although
 * we can guarantee that these functions will base their calculations on a matched
 * set of data, we can not guarantee that it will be the same set of data presented
 * along side the accessory data in the data log. Thus, where it is required to see
 * the inputs that an accessory functions calculations were based on, those values
 * should be cached for logging on a per function basis.
 *
 * Although it seems like a lot of trouble to go to, it is critical to transient
 * performance that the environmental conditions the engine is operating under are
 * tracked and reacted to as quickly as possible. Having the less important stuff
 * run asynchronously will result in an order of magnitude improvement of parameter
 * tracking and is well worth the extra memory expense and complication.
