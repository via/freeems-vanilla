/** @file
 *
 * @brief Static initialisation of non-zero variables
 *
 * This file contains static initialisations for fields that require a non-zero
 * initial value after reset. Zero fields are taken care of by GCC and doing
 * this here means less init time and init code, both good things. Variables
 * initialised here are placed together by the compiler in flash and copied up
 * to RAM as a linear block before the main method runs. This is significantly
 * more efficient than doing them one-by-one in an init routine.
